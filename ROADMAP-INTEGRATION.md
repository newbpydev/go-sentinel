This roadmap follows your systematic TDD approach, with test tasks preceding each implementation task. As we make progress, we'll check off completed items to track our journey through the integration process.

Would you like me to start with Phase 1.1 - Project Structure Analysis, or is there a specific section you'd like to focus on first?
